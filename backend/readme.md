# Express MVC

This is an Express MVC (Model-View-Controller) boilerplate that provides a structured architecture for building web applications using Node.js, Express, and a MVC design pattern. It serves as a foundation for creating scalable and maintainable applications.

## Requirements

- Node.js 12.0.0 or higher
- Express 4.17.1 or higher (installed automatically via `package.json`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arya2004/pulseGuard
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Express
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Express server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Use your preferred web browser to access the application.

## Architecture

This Express MVC boilerplate follows the MVC design pattern, providing a clear separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to maintain and extend. The directory structure is organized as follows:

- `app.js` - Entry point of the application.
- `models/` - Defines the data models and interacts with the database or other data sources.
- `views/` - Contains the templates and views rendered by the controllers.
- `public/` - Static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `middlewares/` - Custom middleware functions used in the application.
- `README.md` - Documentation for the Express MVC boilerplate.

Feel free to modify the structure to suit your specific project needs.


## Deployment

To deploy this Express MVC application to a production environment, consider using deployment methods such as:

- Cloud hosting providers (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform)
- Containerization platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Configuring a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) as a reverse proxy for the Express application

Ensure that you follow security best practices and consider performance and scalability requirements when deploying to a production environment.
