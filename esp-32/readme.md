# ESP32 Code

This folder contains code for programming the ESP32 microcontroller. The code provided serves as a starting point for developing applications and projects using the ESP32 platform.
Use `DISTANCE_HTTP_ESP32.ino` Code to validate working of sever bu simulating different values
Use `PULSE_HTTP_ESP32.ino` code when deploying

## Requirements

To use this code, you need the following:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Arduino IDE or platform-specific IDE (e.g., ESP-IDF) installed

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arya2004/pulse-guard
   ```

2. Open the code in your preferred IDE:

   - For Arduino IDE:
     - Launch the Arduino IDE.
     - Open the `PULSE_HTTP_ESP32.ino` file from the cloned repository.

   - For ESP-IDF:
     - Set up the ESP-IDF development environment according to the platform's instructions.
     - Open the project directory using the IDE.

3. Connect your ESP32 microcontroller to your computer.

4. Configure the necessary settings such as board type, port, and baud rate based on your setup and requirements.

5. Upload the code to the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Usage

The provided code is a basic example that demonstrates certain functionalities of the ESP32. It can be customized and expanded to suit your specific project needs. Modify the code according to your requirements and flash it onto the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Configuration

Depending on your project requirements, you may need to configure various settings within the code. Some common configurations include:

- Wi-Fi settings: SSID, password, access point mode, etc.
- Pin assignments: Define the pin numbers and their respective modes (input/output).
- Sensor or peripheral configurations: Set up communication protocols, sampling rates, and data processing parameters.

Review the code and update the necessary configuration variables or function calls to match your project requirements.
